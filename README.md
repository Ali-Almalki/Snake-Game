**Snake Game with Poison Fruit**

**Snake game Methodology Explanation** 
In this project, we are trying to controll the snake that moves freely into different directions and wants to eat fruits, candies. When snake eats a fruit, it grows in size and grows, but the game is over if snake eats poisonous fruits.  

**Q-learning algorithm with Keras as neural network models used**. 
The dependences of this game are on python, Keras, sci-kit image, and tensor flow. A part of the code in this game builds up with the CNN. Q-Learning algorithm goes on in which gamma parameter settled and initial matrix Q ended to zero. The maximum value of the Q depends upon the number of the state.
